questions:
  - question: Where are you located?
    answer: Moonshine 152 is located at 152 Dorchester Avenue, on the corner of Dorchester Avenue & West 4th Street in South Boston. We are one block from the Broadway Red Line train station, with bus connections to the 9,11 and 47 routes. We are a short walk over the Berkely Bridge from the South End & Ink Block neighborhoods.
  - question: Do you have parking / valet?
    answer: >-
      Currently, we do not offer VALET parking. There is no allotted parking for the restaurant & we suggest on-street parking in the neighborhood, including Dorchester Avenue, West 4th Street & Foundry Street, underneath the West Broadway Bridge. Please check all posted parking signs & residential parking notices, as the city does ticket and tow.
  - question: Do you take reservations?
    answer: >-
      Reservations are accepted via Opentable or telephone up to  60 days in advance. Just click the direct reservation link on our website. Please note reservations will not be accepted via voicemail, email, or social media.
  - question: Do you serve large parties?
    answer: >-
      Due to the intimate size of the restaurant, parties of up to 8 guests can be made online. Any groups larger than 8 must call to speak with a staff member regarding availability. The largest group we can accommodate without private rental of the space would be 20 and is based on availability. All reservations over a party of 8 require a credit card as part of our cancellation policy. If your confirmed reservation needs to be canceled we just ask for 24 hours notice, otherwise, you would be subject to a $25/per person cancellation fee issued in the form of a gift card to Moonshine 152  as a result of the loss of business-level revenue required by Moonshine 152. For all reservations that are canceled with more than 24 hours notice, no cancellation fee will be charged.

      Groups over 20 would fall along the lines of a Private Dining Event.  If interested in hosting a private event for a group larger than 20, please contact our Reservation Coordinator, Amanda Rae, for more information at amanda@moonshine152.com
  - question: Do you have gift cards?
    answer: >-
      We offer gift cards in any denomination. Please give us a call at 617.752.4191 or stop by the restaurant and any member of staff can assist you with purchasing.
