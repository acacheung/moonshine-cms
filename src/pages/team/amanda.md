Born and raised Dorchester Native, Amanda at a young age fell in love with the atmosphere and artistry of the hospitality culture. As a kid, organizing brunches and decorating the dinner table she was bound for a life in the restaurant industry… it was only a matter of time. At 16 she joined the Flour Bakery Team where she learned the value of a tight knit team, the value of neighborhood regulars and the importance of a strong cup of coffee.

Fresh out of High School, Amanda was accepted into the Baking and Pastry Arts Program at Johnson & Wales University in Providence Rhode Island. After a few years working the scene in Providence Amanda shipped back up to Boston where she re-entered the industry at Sportello Restaurant, an up and coming venture from restaurant juggernaut Barbara Lynch. At Sportello she grew the bakery starting as a barista, ending as supervisor. In the bakery, Amanda was able to showcase her spirited personality, her kindness to others and ability to work under pressure. Working under her mentor, Heather Kennaway Lynch, Amanda learned various aspects of running a personable, successful restaurant as well as key hospitality standards. She was also given the opportunity to work nearly every position within the restaurant, learning every step along the way. In July of 2014 Amanda transitioned within the Barbara Lynch Gruppo to No. 9 Park to further cultivate her knowledge of back of the house operations as the Reservationist. There she worked with some of the best in the business, learning the nuances of running a restaurant from behind the scenes.

In the summer of 2013 while working part-time at Sam’s at Louis Boston, Amanda had the pleasure of meeting and working alongside Chef Asia Mei. There they developed a strong working relationship that continues today. At Moonshine 152 Amanda is looking forward to building a strong, dynamic team that is dedicated to supporting Asia as she lives her dream. She looks forward to making new connections in the ever evolving South Boston neighborhood. Amanda’s day to day responsible will include managing the floor during brunch and dinner service, overseeing the front of house staff and helping to create memorable dining experiences.
