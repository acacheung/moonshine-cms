      If you live in the neighborhood, you know the menu — the crowd-pleasing
      jalapeño crab rangoon, the legendary mushroom tofu burger, the famous
      fried chicken and waffles. You know the staff, too, especially
      effervescent chef-owner Asia Mei, who’s always there with a smile as she
      checks in on diners. For weeknight dinners and weekend date nights, this
      is the living room of Southie, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

      Come for rotating Jell-O shots; stay for the funky food, served until 1:30
      a.m. nightly. Peckish? Nosh “party tots” smothered in a mélange of
      sweet-and-spicy sauces. Ravenous? Crush a personal-size meatloaf topped
      with loaded baked-potato “aioli.”

      From delectable vegetarian dishes to satiating naughty hangover cures,
      there is literally something for everyone to love, including the late
      night noshers (kitchen’s open ’til 1:30 am daily, bar open ‘til 2am).
      While menu items may change seasonally, one thing that hasn’t changed is
      Asia’s secret to success: exquisite food and cocktails served in an
      unpretentious, cozy atmosphere by friendly, knowledgeable staff, led by
      one of the most talented chefs the Boston scene has seen. Shine on,
      Moonshine.

      Asia and I snagged a table at Moonshine 152 and chatted about feeling lost
      in life choices, accepting the inevitability of death, and finding “the
      zone.” And of course she answered Five Questions. Meet Asia.

      You have a favorite restaurant. The staff greets you by name. You’re
      seated at a preferred table. That specialty cocktail you like? It’s en
      route before you’ve ordered. Complimentary small dishes appear. Ah, the
      joys of being a regular.

      It’s not hard to see how Moonshine became a hit with hospitality types.
      Chef/owner Asia Mei brings soul to the space that formerly housed the
      Franklin Southie (where she honed her skills early in her career), a dim
      and discreet sanctuary amid the neighborhood’s ostentatious new
      developments. And a late-night menu, served until 1:30 am, keeps
      post-shift tipplers sated with oysters and jalapeño crab rangoons. File
      under: very full moons.

      Chef Asia Mei brings together American East Coast cookery, Far East
      flavors and a penchant for street food under one roof. The result?
      Tantalizing snacks like lamb meatballs with habanero-date jam, jalapeño
      and crab rangoon with spicy honey, and Korean BBQ tacos with Asian pear
      kimchi.

      Growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley, Asia Mei knew she didn’t want
      to be an office drone -- but cooking wasn't always in the picture. She got
      a degree in economics and biology while working as a stuntwoman in LA
      during the summer, but ended up skipping her graduation ceremony to search
      for a job in Boston that would teach her how to cook.

      Southie’s answer to Trina’s Starlite Lounge is open late and serves brunch
      featuring a weekly Ron Swanson special, named for chef-owner Asia Mei’s
      favorite TV character. Edamame hummus and jalapeno crab rangoons, “Mama
      Mei’s” pork noodle soup, Korean barbecue tacos, elegant pork and fish
      dishes, and burgers and butterscotch pudding all find their way to the
      table at an unpretentious neighborhood spot.

      As the owner of Moonshine 152 in South Boston, Asia Mei is one of the
      city’s best young chefs. But she certainly hasn’t taken the most
      traditional path to get to where she is today.
