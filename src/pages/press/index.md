      Come for rotating Jell-O shots; stay for the funky food, served until 1:30
      a.m. nightly. Peckish? Nosh “party tots” smothered in a mélange of
      sweet-and-spicy sauces. Ravenous? Crush a personal-size meatloaf topped
      with loaded baked-potato “aioli.”

      From delectable vegetarian dishes to satiating naughty hangover cures,
      there is literally something for everyone to love, including the late
      night noshers (kitchen’s open ’til 1:30 am daily, bar open ‘til 2am).
      While menu items may change seasonally, one thing that hasn’t changed is
      Asia’s secret to success: exquisite food and cocktails served in an
      unpretentious, cozy atmosphere by friendly, knowledgeable staff, led by
      one of the most talented chefs the Boston scene has seen. Shine on,
      Moonshine.

      zone.” And of course she answered Five Questions. Meet Asia.

      You have a favorite restaurant. The staff greets you by name. You’re
      seated at a preferred table. That specialty cocktail you like? It’s en
      route before you’ve ordered. Complimentary small dishes appear. Ah, the
      joys of being a regular.

      It’s not hard to see how Moonshine became a hit with hospitality types.
      Chef/owner Asia Mei brings soul to the space that formerly housed the
      Franklin Southie (where she honed her skills early in her career), a dim
      and discreet sanctuary amid the neighborhood’s ostentatious new
      developments. And a late-night menu, served until 1:30 am, keeps
      post-shift tipplers sated with oysters and jalapeño crab rangoons. File
      under: very full moons.
