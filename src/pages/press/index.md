      Come for rotating Jell-O shots; stay for the funky food, served until 1:30
      a.m. nightly. Peckish? Nosh “party tots” smothered in a mélange of
      sweet-and-spicy sauces. Ravenous? Crush a personal-size meatloaf topped
      with loaded baked-potato “aioli.”

      From delectable vegetarian dishes to satiating naughty hangover cures,
      there is literally something for everyone to love, including the late
      night noshers (kitchen’s open ’til 1:30 am daily, bar open ‘til 2am).
      While menu items may change seasonally, one thing that hasn’t changed is
      Asia’s secret to success: exquisite food and cocktails served in an
      unpretentious, cozy atmosphere by friendly, knowledgeable staff, led by
      one of the most talented chefs the Boston scene has seen. Shine on,
      Moonshine.

      Asia and I snagged a table at Moonshine 152 and chatted about feeling lost
      in life choices, accepting the inevitability of death, and finding “the
      zone.” And of course she answered Five Questions. Meet Asia.
