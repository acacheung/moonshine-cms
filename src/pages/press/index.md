      Come for rotating Jell-O shots; stay for the funky food, served until 1:30
      a.m. nightly. Peckish? Nosh “party tots” smothered in a mélange of
      sweet-and-spicy sauces. Ravenous? Crush a personal-size meatloaf topped
      with loaded baked-potato “aioli.”

      From delectable vegetarian dishes to satiating naughty hangover cures,
      there is literally something for everyone to love, including the late
      night noshers (kitchen’s open ’til 1:30 am daily, bar open ‘til 2am).
      While menu items may change seasonally, one thing that hasn’t changed is
      Asia’s secret to success: exquisite food and cocktails served in an
      unpretentious, cozy atmosphere by friendly, knowledgeable staff, led by
      one of the most talented chefs the Boston scene has seen. Shine on,
      Moonshine.

      It’s not hard to see how Moonshine became a hit with hospitality types.
      Chef/owner Asia Mei brings soul to the space that formerly housed the
      Franklin Southie (where she honed her skills early in her career), a dim
      and discreet sanctuary amid the neighborhood’s ostentatious new
      developments. And a late-night menu, served until 1:30 am, keeps
      post-shift tipplers sated with oysters and jalapeño crab rangoons. File
      under: very full moons.

      Chef Asia Mei brings together American East Coast cookery, Far East
      flavors and a penchant for street food under one roof. The result?
      Tantalizing snacks like lamb meatballs with habanero-date jam, jalapeño
      and crab rangoon with spicy honey, and Korean BBQ tacos with Asian pear
      kimchi.

      Growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley, Asia Mei knew she didn’t want
      to be an office drone -- but cooking wasn't always in the picture. She got
      a degree in economics and biology while working as a stuntwoman in LA
      during the summer, but ended up skipping her graduation ceremony to search
      for a job in Boston that would teach her how to cook.
